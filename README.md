### Java Trivia: An application in Swing

This application is consistent with my perspective of regarding code as a versatile utility.<br>
It was created for self-help/self-testing purposes: to gauge personal knowledge of keywords in Java in a specified time limit. I welcome all contributors to use it to their benefit(s) with the required modifications and inform me of the same so that I may learn too. <hr>
The current version of the project does not work as I inteded it to, and I am/shall be working on the rectification and improvement of the same. I stand open to all suggestions for its betterment. <br><br>

#### Of all things, Java SWING? *Really?*
A now deprecated alternative, it was purposely chosen without any external integrations.


### What good is that?
* Revision: Java Swing was a part of curriculum of one of the subjects in my Engeneering Years. This was my attempt to familiarize myself with the *application* (puns intended) of it, rather than concentrating on just theory and refusing to understand its use when many more better ways exist for the same purpose.
* Challenge: Remembering all Java keywords in 5 minutes. Seemed easy, turned out not to be. I thought of making something that helped me do this. Two birds in one shot (just a phrase; I am against animal violence).


### Current status 
As on 24th November 2018:
* The 'Give Up' option does what it is supposed to. Alongside, it throws a list or errors on the console
* The 'Next' button doesn't add the entered word to the cell; throws a similar list of errors as in the aforementioned case
* The timer for the countdown is incompletely implemented (bottom-right). <br>
*(To be updated)*

### Progress
The logic and syntaxes in the extant code are under review and testing, with further search for alternatives. Online and offline references, community advices, forums, documentations, and hit-and-trial methods are used.
