### Java Trivia: An application in Swing

This application is consistent with my perspective regarding code as a versatile utility.<br>
It was created for self-help/self-testing purposes: to gauge personal knowledge of keywords in Java in a specified time limit. All contributors are welcome to use it to their benefit(s) with the required modifications and inform me of the same so that I may learn too. <hr>
The current version of the project does not work as originally inteded to; work shall be done for the rectification and improvement of the same. All suggestions for its betterment are welcome. <br><br>

#### Java SWING?
 Purposely chosen without any external integrations (a now deprecated alternative).


### Current status 
As on 30th March 2019:
* The 'Give Up' button does what it is supposed to. Throws a list or errors on the console alongside.
* The 'Next' button doesn't add the entered word to the cell; throws a similar list of errors as in the aforementioned case
* The timer for the countdown is incompletely implemented (bottom-right). <br>
*(To be updated)*

### Progress
The logic and syntaxes in the extant code are under review and testing, with further search for alternatives. Online and offline references, community advices, forums, documentations, and hit-and-trial methods are used.
